===================

File:              migrations/env.py
Component:         Migrations — Alembic environment
Purpose:           Run migrations against the supplied PostgreSQL runtime.
Interacts With:    alembic.ini, migrations/versions/, PostgreSQL, src/api/audit_lab.py
Sprint/Task:       Sprint 2 — Project 2 / Task 2.6 (Task 4.9: the database argument)
Concepts:          Version-controlled schema evolution
Tools:             Python 3.12, Alembic, SQLAlchemy, asyncpg

This environment is supplied and protected. Three decisions in it are worth
knowing while you write a migration.

Autogeneration is deliberately off. There is no model metadata to compare
against, because the schema is owned by explicit SQL rather than by an ORM, so
`alembic revision --autogenerate` has nothing to diff. You write `upgrade` and
`downgrade` yourself, which is also what makes the rollback real rather than
guessed.

The database URL comes from `COLDLINE_DATABASE_URL`, which the container
already provides. No connection string is committed to this repository, and
`alembic revision` never connects at all - only `upgrade` and `downgrade` do.

From Task 4.9, `-x database=<name>` points one run at another database on the
same server, keeping the rest of the URL. `poe verify` uses it to migrate a
database of its own, created fresh for each run; `poe migrate` never passes it,
so your own commands always migrate the stack's database.
