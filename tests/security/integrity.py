===================

File:              tests/security/integrity.py
Component:         Security tooling — Verification integrity snapshot
Purpose:           Prove that the files `poe verify` judged are the files it finished with.
Interacts With:    pyproject.toml (`poe verify`), submission.yaml, src/common/audit_queries.py,
                    docs/student/audit-query-record.md, migrations/, docs/governance/,
                    docs/security/, docs/student/, src/, security/, .gitleaks.toml,
                    .semgrepignore, tests/contract/, tests/security/, tests/student/,
                    tests/fixtures/, schemas/, config/auth.yaml, infra/corpus/, infra/audit/,
                    infra/postgres/, alembic.ini, uv.lock, the task and security workflows
Sprint/Task:       Sprint 4 — Project 4 / Task 4.9
Concepts:          Trusted bookends around a run, content hashes, tamper evidence
Tools:             Python 3.12, hashlib, json

``poe verify`` checks the answer sheet and the permitted-files boundary, then runs the stack,
the slow-query checks and the checks on the inherited controls, in the middle of a sequence
of trusted steps. A file edited after a check read it would make the run's verdicts describe
a tree that no longer exists. This module is the first and the last step of ``poe verify``:

- ``record`` (``poe integrity-record``) hashes the answer sheet, the student files and every
  trusted file the checks rely on (``TRUSTED_PATHS``) and writes the SHA-256 digests to a
  file **outside the repository**, in the system temporary directory, named after this
  checkout's path;
- ``check`` (``poe integrity-check``) recomputes them and fails, naming each file, if any was
  changed, added, or removed while verification ran. The snapshot is deleted after the
  check, so a later ``check`` without its ``record`` reports that, not a stale comparison.

``migrations/versions/`` is covered whole, so a revision added or edited while the run was
in progress is named. The evidence file ``poe attack-dev`` writes under ``evidence/``, the
reports under ``reports/security/`` and the scanner cache under ``.tools/`` are written by
runs, not supplied, and are not covered. This detects tampering during the run; it is not a
sandbox. Grading uses the committed tree, which no code in a checkout can rewrite, and the
hosted job runs ``poe verify`` whole, so an edit there turns the job red at this last step.
